TODO
Rebuild the face/video element to support a lower third gradient overlay
Separate the gameplay so that both players have to draw their own cards
Make the deck images change to larger/smaller decks after each turn to show progress
Add some kind of visual highlight to the player's deck before their first click




MAYBE
Rotate cards a bit more when they get scattered
Add a toggle for left-handed mode, which would mirror the existing layour
Un-hardcode the animation speeds
Play a sound effect whenever a card moves
Make the opponent's cards display upside down
Try to remove some Javascript DOM references for (micro) optimization




DESKTOP BROWSER BUGS (Lower priority since this would be deployed via app, not web browser)
Add IE11 support
